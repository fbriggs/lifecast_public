THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT ("EULA") IS MADE BETWEEN YOU, AN INDIVIDUAL PERSON OR LEGAL ENTITY ("Licensee") AND LIFECAST INCORPORATED ("Lifecast"). THIS EULA GOVERNS LICENSEE'S USE OF THE SOFTWARE (DEFINED IN SECTION 1). LIFECAST AND LICENSEE ARE SOMETIMES REFERRED TO INDIVIDUALLY IN THIS EULA AS A "Party" AND COLLECTIVELY AS THE "Parties".

BY ACCEPTING THIS EULA THROUGH THE REQUIRED PROCESS OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING OR USING THE SOFTWARE, LICENSEE REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT: (1) LICENSEE HAS READ AND UNDERSTANDS THIS EULA, AND AGREES TO BE BOUND LEGALLY BY THIS EULA; (2) IF LICENSEE IS AN INDIVIDUAL, LICENSEE IS AT LEAST 18 YEARS OF AGE; AND (3) IF LICENSEE IS A LEGAL ENTITY, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT, POWER, AND AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO THIS EULA ON BEHALF OF LICENSEE AND TO LEGALLY BIND LICENSEE TO THIS EULA.

IF LICENSEE DOES NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS EULA, LIFECAST WILL NOT AND DOES NOT LICENSE THE SOFTWARE TO LICENSEE AND LICENSEE MUST NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SOFTWARE.

General Description. Lifecast has developed a proprietary software application that makes tools for stabilized 6DOF VR video and 3D scene reconstruction with arrays of cameras and other sensors. As used in this EULA, the term "Software" refers to an object code version of the proprietary software application described in the prior sentence, including any related documentation that Lifecast makes available to Licensee.

License. Subject to Licensee's compliance with this EULA, Lifecast hereby grants to Licensee during the Term (defined in Section 7 below) a non-exclusive, non-transferable (except under Section 14), non-sublicensable, worldwide and royalty-free license to download and use the Software in the manner permitted by the Software's functionalities, on a single computing device owned or controlled by Licensee. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 2 and any other terms in this EULA, any third party code (including open source software) that may be incorporated into the Software is covered by the applicable license terms governing such code and nothing in this EULA limits or supersedes those terms. For a list of the open source components included in the Software, please refer to the list at the end of this document.

Restrictions. Lifecast reserves all rights that are not expressly granted to Licensee in Section 2. Without limiting the preceding sentence, Licensee will not, and will not assist or authorize any third party to: (a) copy, modify, translate, or create derivative works of the Software; (b) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise attempt to reconstruct, identify or discover any source code, underlying ideas, underlying user interface techniques, or algorithms of the Software, except to the extent such restriction is impermissible under applicable law; (c) lend, rent, lease, offer for sale, sell or otherwise distribute the Software to any third party; (d) attempt to circumvent any license, timing or use restrictions that are built into the Software; or (e) use the Software in violation of this EULA, any applicable laws, rules or regulations or any third party rights. Without limiting the foregoing, Licensee may not use the Software in any manner that would require any portion of the Software (other than any open source software therein) to be subject to the terms of any open source or similar license.

Ownership; Feedback. As between the Parties, Lifecast solely owns and retains all right, title and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in and to the Software subject only to the limited license granted in Section 2. If Licensee makes available to Lifecast any comments, suggestions, ideas or other information or materials regarding Licensee's use of and/or experience with the Software or otherwise related to the Software (collectively, "Feedback"), then Licensee hereby grants to Lifecast a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, worldwide and royalty-free license, with the right to make and authorize sublicenses, to reproduce, make derivative works of, distribute, publicly display and perform, make, have made, sell, offer for sale, import, use and otherwise exploit the Feedback in any manner and for any purpose without any restriction, credit, attribution or fees due to Licensee.

Fees. If Lifecast charges fees in connection with access to or use of the Software, those fees will be set forth in a separate written document between the Parties. Lifecast may choose in its sole discretion to charge fees for certain or all uses of the Software. Lifecast will notify Licensee of the same before they go into effect.

Data. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this EULA, Lifecast may collect and compile data and information related to Licensee's use of the Software ("Data"). As between the Parties, all right, title, and interest in Data, including all intellectual property rights therein, belong solely to and are retained solely by Lifecast. Licensee agrees that Lifecast may use Data to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, and hereby consents to such use, provided that Lifecast will not publicly disclose Data in a form where it specifically and directly identifies Licensee.

Term and Termination. This EULA will commence on the date when Licensee accepts the EULA through the required process or otherwise accesses or uses the Software and will continue until it is terminated by either Party ("Term"). Lifecast may terminate the EULA without or without notice to Licensee for any or no reason. Licensee may terminate the EULA by providing written notice of the same to Lifecast at eula@lifecastvr.com. Upon termination, the license granted to Licensee in Section 2 will immediately terminate, and Licensee must permanently delete all copies of the Software within Licensee's possession or control. Sections 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15, and all defined terms used in any of those Sections, or required to interpret any of those Sections, will survive any termination of this EULA.

Disclaimers and Limitations on Liability. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, AND WITHOUT LIMITING ANY OTHER TERMS IN THIS EULA, THE FOLLOWING TERMS APPLY:
(a) THE LIFECAST SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED SOLELY "AS IS", "AS AVAILABLE" AND WITH ALL FAULTS, AND LIFECAST DOES NOT MAKE, AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS, ANY AND ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THIS EULA, INCLUDING ALL WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE PRACTICE.
(b) IN NO EVENT WILL LIFECAST BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR FOR LOST REVENUE, LOST PROFITS, COST OF REPLACEMENT OF GOODS OR SERVICES, LOSS OF TECHNOLOGY, GOODWILL, RIGHTS OR SERVICES, LOSS OF DATA OR INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF USE OF SERVICE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS EULA. LIFECAST'S TOTAL LIABILITY TO LICENSEE FOR ALL CLAIMS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS EULA WILL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY LICENSEE TO LIFECAST DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE APPLICABLE CLAIM(S).
(c) THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 8 WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE APPLICABLE LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT LIFECAST HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE. INSOFAR AS APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS ANY LIMITATION ON LIABILITY IN THIS EULA, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT SUCH LIMITATION WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY MODIFIED, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT SO AS TO MAKE THE LIMITATION COMPLIANT WITH APPLICABLE LAW. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITIES SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE AGREED ALLOCATIONS OF RISK AND SUCH LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.

Indemnification. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Licensee will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Lifecast, its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, consultants, agents, licensors and suppliers (together, the "Lifecast Entities") from and against every claim, action, suit or proceeding brought by a third party, and any related liability, damage, loss, and expense, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, arising out of or in connection with: (a) Licensee's use or misuse of the Software; (b) Licensee's breach of this EULA; (c) Licensee's use of the Software in a manner that violates any third party rights or any applicable law, rule or regulation; or (d) any dispute or issue between Licensee and any third party. Lifecast reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter which is subject to indemnification under this Section 9 at Licensee's sole expense if Lifecast believes that Licensee is unwilling or incapable of defending Lifecast's interests. In such case, Licensee agrees to cooperate with any reasonable requests assisting Lifecast's defense of such matter at Licensee's sole expense.

Governing Law and Dispute Resolution.

This EULA will be interpreted, construed, and enforced in all respects in accordance with the local laws of the State of California, without reference to its choice of law rules and not including the provisions of the 1980 U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.
Any dispute with respect to this EULA will be settled by binding arbitration in San Mateo County, California, under the Rules of the American Arbitration Association by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with such rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The prevailing Party will be entitled to receive from the other Party its attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with any arbitration or litigation instituted in connection with this EULA. LICENSEE UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS EULA, LICENSEE AND LIFECAST ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

Notwithstanding the foregoing in Section 10(b), Licensee acknowledges and agrees that a breach or threatened breach of this EULA would cause Lifecast irreparable harm for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and agrees that, in the event of such breach or threatened breach, Lifecast will be entitled to equitable relief and any other relief that may be available from any court of competent jurisdiction, without any requirement to post a bond or other security, or to prove actual damages or that monetary damages are not an adequate remedy. Such remedies are not exclusive and are in addition to all other remedies that may be available at law, in equity, or otherwise.

Changes. Licensee understands and agrees that Lifecast may change this EULA at any time without prior notice. Lifecast will endeavor to provide Licensee with prior notice of any material changes to this EULA. Licensee may read a current, effective copy of this EULA at any time by selecting the appropriate link on the Lifecast website located https://lifecastvr.com/eula.html. The revised EULA will become effective at the time of posting on such website, and Licensee's use of the Software after such time will constitute Licensee's acceptance of the revised EULA. If any change to this EULA is not acceptable to Licensee, then Licensee's sole remedy is to stop using the Software.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentences of this Section 11, no revisions to this EULA will apply to any dispute between Licensee and Lifecast that arose prior to the effective date of those revisions.

Export Regulation; Sanctions.

The Software may be subject to US export control laws, including the Export Control Reform Act and its associated regulations. The Licensee will not, directly or indirectly, export, re-export, or release the Software to, or make the Software accessible from, any jurisdiction or country to which export, re-export, or release is prohibited by law, rule, or regulation.

Licensee covenants that it is not, and at all times during the Term will not be: (i) the target of any Laws administered by the United States Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") or any other governmental entity imposing economic sanctions and trade embargoes; or (ii) located, organized, or resident in a country or territory that is, or whose government is, the target of sanctions imposed by OFAC or any other governmental entity.

Government Rights. The Software is commercial computer software, as such term is defined in 48 C.F.R. S2.101. Accordingly, if the Licensee is the US Government or any contractor therefor, Licensee shall receive only those rights with respect to the Software as are granted to all other end users under license, in accordance with (a) 48 C.F.R. S227.7201 through 48 C.F.R. S227.7204, with respect to the Department of Defense and their contractors, or (b) 48 C.F.R. S12.212, with respect to all other US Government licensees and their contractors.

Miscellaneous. Licensee agrees that no joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship exists between Licensee and Lifecast as a result of this EULA. If any provision of this EULA is found to be invalid by any court or arbitrator having competent jurisdiction, then the invalidity of such provision will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this EULA, which will remain in full force and effect. Failure of Lifecast to act on or enforce any provision of this EULA will not be construed as a waiver of that provision or any other provision in this EULA. No waiver will be effective against Lifecast unless made in writing, and no such waiver will be construed as a waiver in any other instance. This EULA constitutes the entire agreement between Licensee and Lifecast with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all previous or contemporaneous agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. The Section headings are provided merely for convenience and will not be given any legal import. This EULA will inure to the benefit of the parties' successors and assigns. Licensee may not assign this EULA or any of the rights or licenses granted hereunder without the prior express written consent of Lifecast. Lifecast may assign this EULA, including all of its rights hereunder, without restriction. This EULA may only be amended in a writing signed by an authorized representative of each party, except as provided in Section 11. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that Licensee had the opportunity to consult legal counsel in connection with this EULA even if Licensee chose not to do so, and this EULA will not be construed against Licensee or Lifecast as drafter.
