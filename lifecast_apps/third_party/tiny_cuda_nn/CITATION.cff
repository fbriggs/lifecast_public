  This is a small, self-contained framework for training and querying neural
  networks. Most notably, it contains a lightning fast "fully fused" multi-
  layer perceptron (technical paper), a versatile multiresolution hash encoding
  (technical paper), as well as support for various other input encodings,
  losses, and optimizers.
